## Panel controls

The `PS Agent Bridge` panel provides:

- Connection status line (`Connected`/`Disconnected`)
- Single connect/disconnect toggle button
- Transaction log (append-only, scrollable)
- `Clear Log` button

## Required permissions

`photoshop-uxp-bridge/manifest.json` requires:

- Network access to all domains (`requiredPermissions.network.domains = "all"`)
- Local file system full access (`requiredPermissions.localFileSystem = "fullAccess"`)

If network permission is missing or stale, bridge polling fails with URL permission errors.

## Connection flow

1. Bridge daemon receives CLI calls on `/rpc`.
2. UXP plugin registers client on `/bridge/register`.
3. Plugin long-polls `/bridge/poll`.
4. Plugin executes operations and returns `/bridge/result`.

## Reload rule

After plugin code or manifest changes:

1. Run `npm run bridge:reload` (macOS automation path).
2. If automation is unavailable, reload from UXP Developer Tool manually.
3. Reconnect in panel UI only if auto-connect did not succeed.

Do not run Photoshop integration tests until reload is confirmed.
