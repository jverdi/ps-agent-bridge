## Integration tests

Run end-to-end tests against the mock bridge:

```bash
npm run test:integration
```

Coverage includes:

- Full planned operation payload through CLI -> adapter -> `/rpc`.
- Mutation assertions for layer/text outcomes.
- Dry-run non-mutation behavior.
- Abort vs continue behavior.
- Rollback with checkpoint behavior.

## Manual Photoshop smoke tests

1. Start daemon: `npm run dev -- bridge daemon`
2. Reload plugin in UXP Developer Tool.
3. Connect bridge in panel.
4. Run operation payloads with `npm run dev -- op apply -f <file>`.
5. Inspect Photoshop layer state and panel logs.

## High-signal verification commands

```bash
npm run dev -- doctor
npm run dev -- bridge status
npm run dev -- layer list
npm run dev -- doc manifest
npm run dev -- events tail --count 50
```

## Required gate after bridge changes

After any change that affects plugin runtime or manifest, reload plugin and reconnect before running tests.
