## `Permission denied to http://127.0.0.1:43120`

Likely causes:

- Plugin was not reloaded after manifest permission update.
- UXP panel is stale and not connected.

Fix:

1. Reload plugin in UXP Developer Tool.
2. Reopen panel and connect bridge.
3. Confirm with `psagent bridge status`.

## `Manifest entry not found`

Plugin bundle is out of sync with UXP loader state.

Fix:

- Remove and re-add plugin folder in UXP Developer Tool.
- Reload plugin and reconnect.

## `Could not complete your request because of a program error`

Generic Photoshop error, usually from host state mismatch (active tool mode, missing target, unsupported descriptor in current state).

Fix:

- Exit text-edit/transform/modal dialogs.
- Retry operation.
- Check panel transaction log for failing op index.

## `The command “Delete” is not currently available` or `The command “Make” is not currently available`

Action Manager command attempted in invalid state or without valid target.

Fix:

- Verify target layer/document exists.
- Ensure active document is valid and unlocked for mutation.
- Prefer canonical high-level ops before raw `batchPlay` descriptors.

## `One or more selections cannot be exported because they are empty`

Export path expects an active non-empty selection.

Fix:

- Use document export (`exportDocument`) instead of selection export path when selection is optional.
- Set/verify selection before layer export flows.

## Save dialog blocks and timeouts

A hidden Save As dialog can stall automation.

Fix:

- Prefer `saveDocumentAs` with explicit `output`.
- Avoid `saveDocument` on unsaved docs unless dialog flow is intentional.

## Modal state busy failures

If Photoshop is in modal state, bridge retries internally and then fails with a clear message.

Fix:

- Exit modal workflows and retry.
- Keep operation transactions smaller when debugging.
