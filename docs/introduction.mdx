PS Agent Bridge helps you automate Photoshop from the command line or through a coding agent like Codex or Claude Code.

Instead of repeating manual edits in Photoshop, you can describe what you want, run clear commands, and get consistent outputs.

## The pieces at a glance

- `PS Agent Bridge` Photoshop panel: connects Photoshop to automation.
- Bridge daemon (`psagent bridge daemon`): local service that relays commands to the panel.
- `psagent` CLI: run commands directly yourself.
- Skill (`/skill.md`): gives coding agents clear instructions for using PS Agent Bridge safely.

## What you can do with it

- Apply repeatable layer and text changes across files.
- Build predictable creative workflows for exports and handoff.
- Let an agent orchestrate steps while Photoshop stays local on your machine.

## Use with Codex or Claude Code

1. Add the skill:

```bash
npx skills add https://ps-agent-bridge.jaredverdi.com
```

2. Install the CLI and start the daemon:

```bash
npm install -g @jverdi/ps-agent-bridge
psagent bridge daemon
```

3. Open Photoshop, install the `PS Agent Bridge` plugin, and connect to the daemon in it's panel.

4. Ask your agent to run PS Agent Bridge tasks.
